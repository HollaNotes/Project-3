Montebello Blvd. in the city of  Montebello. Completed in 2021 this property is composed of 3 three-story structures with approximately 26250 SF of rentable space sitting on a parcel of approximately 22678 SF. A condominium map has been filed for this property and the map will be recorded prior to close of escrow.    The units at this property are significantly larger than other for-rent units typically found in the market and are perfectly positioned for multi-generational families and work-from-home roommate environments. All fifteen units are large 5br 3.75ba three-story townhome units of approximately 1750 square feet with attached two-car garages. For-rent townhomes of this size and bedroom count are extremely hard if not impossible to find in the Montebello market especially in newly constructed buildings.

The demand for multi-generational housing accommodations has vaulted in popularity and these large townhome units certainly help fill this need.    In terms of amenities each unit in this building benefits from an attached two-car garage with immediate access to the living space. There are five additional uncovered surface parking spaces for guests and overflow parking. All units have a private balcony central heating and air conditioning and an open kitchen layout with a large kitchen island. Washer/dryer hookups are provided in a full laundry room on the third floor of each unit and the bedroom and bathroom on the first floor of each unit is ADA compliant. Tenants are responsible for their own electricity and gas bills and they are billed separately by sub-metering company Minol for water sewer and trash.    The neighborhood surrounding the subject property is residential in nature and is composed primarily of well-maintained single-family homes and small apartment buildings. The property is located in south Montebello and is located a short distance north of the I-5 freeway and access to this important arterial is excellent.
